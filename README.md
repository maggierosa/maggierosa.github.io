## About Me 

I am a self-motivated Ph.D. student at (lWeill Cornell Medicine.md) under the supervision of [(https://physiology.med.cornell.edu/people/george-khelashvili-ph-d/)](another-page.md).

## Research Interests 
I have always wondered how drugs interact with our bodies to produce the desired effect, and how technology can be used to accelerate drug development and delivery. In the pursuit of answers, I earned a B.Sc.(Hons) in Biochemistry from Queen Mary University of London, where I was fascinated in studying drug-receptor interactions. I decided to further pursue my interests by completing a M.Sc. in Drug Discovery and Development at University College London, where my passion for computational drug-design was ignited. During my Master’s thesis I investigated the structural modeling of SARS-CoV-2 main protease using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, where I was thrilled to have my work published contributing to the scientific field during an emerging pandemic. My curiosity for innovative technologies fueled my desire to complete a 6-month internship at Roche, where I used unsupervised ML algorithms for drug substance development. To further deepen my knowledge on how technology can be used to accelerate drug development, for my graduate studies, I am pursuing computational biophysics research at Weill Cornell Medicine under the supervision of Prof. George Khelashvili, where we focus on investigating the function-related molecular mechanisms underlying various biological processes vital to human health using advanced quantitative computational approaches carried out on high-performance computing clusters.
