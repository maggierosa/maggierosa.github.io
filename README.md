## About Me ##

Hi! My name is Margarida Rosa, you can call me Maggie :) and my preferred pronouns are she/her. 
I am originally from Portugal, but I completed my Bachelors and Masters in London, lived in Switzerland for six-months, and now I am in NYC pursuing a Ph.D. at [Weill Cornell Medicine](Weill Cornell.html)(https://www.weill.cornell.edu) under the supervision of [Prof. George Khelashvili](https://www.physiology.med.cornell.edu/people/george-khelashvili-ph-d).

## Research Interests ##

### Using innovative computational technologies such as state-of-art atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and advanced biophysics methods like Machine Learning (ML) techniques to investigate membrane protein biophysics in a physiological and biological setting focused on drug development.

I have always wondered how drugs interact with our bodies to produce the desired effect, and how technology can be used to accelerate drug development and delivery. In the pursuit of answers, I earned a B.Sc.(Hons) in Biochemistry from [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk), where I was fascinated in studying drug-receptor interactions. I decided to further pursue my interests by completing a M.Sc. in Drug Discovery and Development at [University College London](UCL.html), where my passion for computational drug-design was ignited. During my Master’s thesis I investigated the structural modeling of SARS-CoV-2 main protease using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, where I was thrilled to have my work published contributing to the scientific field during an emerging pandemic. My curiosity for innovative technologies fueled my desire to complete a 6-month internship at [Roche](Roche.html), where I used unsupervised ML algorithms for drug substance development. To further deepen my knowledge on how technology can be used to accelerate drug development, for my graduate studies, I am pursuing computational biophysics research. In the [Khelashvili lab](Lab.html), we focus on investigating the function-related molecular mechanisms underlying various biological processes vital to human health using advanced quantitative computational approaches carried out on high-performance computing clusters.
